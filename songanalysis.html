<h3><mark>"Waiting on the World to Change"</mark></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout this song analysis process I learned a few different things.
     First, I gathered a further understanding of the <i>generational lense.</i>
     Through analysing John Mayer's lyrics in <b><i>“Waiting on the World to Change”</i></b>,
     I was able to see another perspective which was able to give me insight into
     how the generation above me, millennials, sees older generations. Second,
     I was given the opportunity to look further into the issues with our society
     that John Mayer described. Despite Mayers overall message, my own analysis
     of his ‘story’ allowed me to see how we will remain stuck in a loop of
     corruption if we don’t try to step up and make changes.</p>

<h3><mark>"Ain't That a Kick in the Head"</mark></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Third, by listening to Dean Martin's song <b><i>“Ain’t that a Kick in the Head”</i></b>,
    I was able to look more into the  experiences of people within a specific
     gender and sexual orientation lense. As someone who is a female, this song
      has provided me with insight into the straight male experience with
      relationships. I was able to see how guys are affected by girls that
      they love and what things they really look for. Lastly, this project
      taught me how to have a deeper insight into the true meaning behind
      songs. Most of the time when I listen to music I tend to focus on the
      rhythm and beat in the song rather than the message the artist is trying
      to convey. Furthermore, by focusing on the message within these songs,
      I was able to understand the instrumental, vocal and lyrical choices
      the musician made, and how they translate to the message being described.</p>
